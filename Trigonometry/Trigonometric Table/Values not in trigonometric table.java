The trigonometric table is a useful reference tool for calculating trigonometric values for specific angles. While the table may provide values for common angles like 0, 30, 45, 60, and 90 degrees (or their equivalent in radians), it does not limit you to solving problems only for those angles. Instead, you can use the information in the table to infer or interpolate values for angles in between.

Here's how you can use the trigonometric table for angles between the commonly listed ones:

1. **Interpolation:** For angles between the given values (e.g., 25, 29, 59, 37, 87), you can estimate the trigonometric values by interpolating between the values listed in the table. For example, if you need the sine of 25 degrees, you can estimate it based on the values for 0 and 30 degrees.

2. **Trigonometric Identities:** You can use trigonometric identities to express angles in terms of sum, difference, double-angle, or half-angle formulas. For instance, you can express the sine or cosine of 25 degrees in terms of the sine and cosine of 30 degrees and 15 degrees.

3. **Calculator or Software:** For precise calculations, especially for non-standard angles, you can use a calculator or software to find the exact trigonometric values. Modern calculators often have trigonometric functions that can provide accurate results for any angle.

4. **Graphs:** Visualizing trigonometric functions on graphs can also help you understand the behavior of these functions for angles between the commonly listed ones.

In practical applications, you often encounter angles that are not in the standard set of values, and being able to work with intermediate angles is essential. Trigonometric tables are a helpful starting point, but the ability to interpolate and use trigonometric identities allows you to extend your calculations to a broader range of angles.
