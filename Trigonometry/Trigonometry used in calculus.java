To study calculus, you should have a solid understanding of several topics in trigonometry. Here are the key trigonometric concepts that are particularly important for calculus:

1. **Trigonometric Functions:**
   - Sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), cotangent (cot), secant (sec), and cosecant (csc).
   - Understanding the definitions of these functions in terms of ratios in a right-angled triangle.

2. **Graphs of Trigonometric Functions:**
   - Understanding the graphs of sine and cosine functions, including their periodic nature.
   - Recognizing amplitude, period, phase shift, and other characteristics of trigonometric graphs.

3. **Trigonometric Identities:**
   - Fundamental trigonometric identities, such as the Pythagorean identity: \( \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1 \).
   - Sum and difference identities, double-angle identities, and half-angle identities.

4. **Trigonometric Equations:**
   - Solving trigonometric equations, including equations involving multiple angles.

5. **Inverse Trigonometric Functions:**
   - Understanding and working with inverse trigonometric functions, such as arcsin, arccos, and arctan.

6. **Trigonometric Limits:**
   - Knowing how to evaluate limits involving trigonometric functions.

7. **Trigonometric Integrals:**
   - Integrating functions involving trigonometric expressions.

8. **Trigonometric Substitution:**
   - Applying trigonometric substitution to simplify and solve integrals.

9. **Polar Coordinates:**
   - Understanding polar coordinates and expressing points in polar form using trigonometric functions.

10. **Parametric Equations:**
    - Working with parametric equations involving trigonometric functions.

A strong foundation in these trigonometric concepts will greatly benefit your understanding of calculus, especially when dealing with functions, limits, derivatives, and integrals that involve trigonometric expressions. It's also important to be comfortable with algebraic manipulations and be able to apply trigonometric concepts in various problem-solving scenarios.
