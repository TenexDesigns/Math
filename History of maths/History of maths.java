The 19th century was a pivotal time in the history of mathematics, marked by significant advancements, formalization of mathematical concepts, and the development of new mathematical theories. Here are some key aspects of mathematics in the 19th century:

### 1. **Formalization of Mathematics:**
   - **Definition:** Formalization in mathematics refers to the process of establishing precise definitions, axioms, and logical structures for mathematical concepts. It involves making mathematical reasoning more rigorous and systematic.
   - **Contributions:**
     - **Set Theory:** Mathematicians like Georg Cantor contributed to the development of set theory, which provided a foundation for formalizing mathematical structures.
     - **Axiomatic Systems:** Mathematicians, including David Hilbert, worked on formulating axiomatic systems to establish a solid foundation for various branches of mathematics.

### 2. **Mathematics in Higher Education:**
   - **Universities:** During the 19th century, the study of mathematics became more formalized in universities, and higher education institutions played a crucial role in the advancement of mathematical knowledge.
   - **Research Journals:** The establishment of research journals allowed mathematicians to share their findings with a wider audience and contributed to the dissemination of mathematical knowledge.

### 3. **Mathematics in Applied Sciences:**
   - **Physics:** Mathematical methods and theories became increasingly intertwined with physics. For instance, the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss and others in celestial mechanics and electromagnetism.
   - **Engineering:** The development of mathematical tools and methods played a vital role in engineering applications.

### 4. **New Mathematical Theories:**
   - **Non-Euclidean Geometry:** The discovery and development of non-Euclidean geometries by mathematicians like Nikolai Lobachevsky and János Bolyai challenged traditional ideas about geometry.
   - **Group Theory:** Évariste Galois laid the foundations of group theory, contributing to the understanding of symmetries and transformations.

### 5. **Fields of Mathematics:**
   - **Number Theory:** Developments in number theory, including the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles.
   - **Algebraic Geometry:** Advances in algebraic geometry, especially the work of Alexandre Grothendieck in the latter half of the 20th century.
   - **Topology:** The emergence of topology as a distinct field, with contributions from mathematicians like Henri Poincaré.
   - **Analysis:** Advances in real and complex analysis, including the development of measure theory.

### 6. **Computational Mathematics:**
   - The early beginnings of computational mathematics, as seen in the work of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage on the Analytical Engine.

### 7. **History of Mathematics:**
   - The 19th century witnessed a growing interest in the history of mathematics, with scholars like Augustus De Morgan and others contributing to the understanding of the historical development of mathematical ideas.

The 19th century laid the groundwork for much of the mathematics we know today. The formalization of mathematical concepts, the establishment of axiomatic systems, and the development of new mathematical theories played a crucial role in shaping the landscape of modern mathematics. The century saw a transition from classical mathematics to a more abstract and rigorous mathematical framework.
