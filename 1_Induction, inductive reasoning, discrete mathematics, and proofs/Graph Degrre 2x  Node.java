It seems there might be a slight misunderstanding in your statement. In graph theory, the degree of a node refers to the number of edges incident to the node, not the other way around. Specifically:

- **Node (Vertex) Degree:** The degree of a node in a graph is the number of edges connected to that node.

- **Edge Degree:** Edges themselves do not have degrees. Instead, they connect nodes, and each node has a degree based on the number of edges connected to it.

In a simple undirected graph, where edges have no direction, the degree of a node is the count of edges that are connected to it. For a directed graph, nodes have both an in-degree (number of incoming edges) and an out-degree (number of outgoing edges).

Now, let's clarify the relationship between degrees and edges in a graph:

- **Statement:** "In a graph, the sum of all node degrees is twice the number of edges."
  
- **Formula:** For an undirected graph \( G \) with \( n \) nodes and \( m \) edges, the statement can be expressed as:
  
  \[ \sum_{v \in V} \text{deg}(v) = 2m \]

  where \( \text{deg}(v) \) is the degree of node \( v \), \( V \) is the set of nodes, and \( m \) is the number of edges.

### Use Cases:

1. **Handshaking Lemma:**
   - The formula is often referred to as the Handshaking Lemma.
   - It is widely used in graph theory proofs and calculations.

2. **Networks and Connections:**
   - In computer science, graphs model various networks and connections.
   - Understanding node degrees helps analyze the structure and connectivity of networks.

3. **Algorithms:**
   - In algorithms that traverse or analyze graphs, knowing node degrees can optimize certain operations.

4. **Network Flow:**
   - In network flow problems, understanding the distribution of edges among nodes is crucial.

Understanding the relationship between node degrees and edges is fundamental in graph theory and has practical applications in computer science, networking, and various algorithmic problems.
